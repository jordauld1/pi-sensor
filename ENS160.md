ENS160 Air Quality Sensor – Outputs & Standards Summary
The ENS160 is a digital multi-gas sensor that integrates metal oxide (MOX) technology with on‐chip algorithms to deliver ready-to-use air quality metrics. It provides several standard outputs without requiring extra host computation. The primary outputs are:

TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds)
eCO₂ (Equivalent CO₂)
AQI (Air Quality Index)
Each output is derived from advanced sensor fusion and automatic baseline correction algorithms, with built-in temperature and humidity compensation to enhance measurement accuracy.

Detailed Output Specifications
TVOC
Description:
Measures the total concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air.
Range:
0 to 65,000 parts per billion (ppb)
Standards & Calibration:
The sensor’s design follows international classification criteria (e.g. ISO 16000-29) to ensure that the TVOC measurement reflects a broad spectrum of indoor VOCs. This parameter is widely used as an indicator in indoor air quality monitoring and demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) systems.
eCO₂ (Equivalent CO₂)
Description:
Provides a standardized CO₂-equivalent value calculated from VOC levels (using a “Reverse Metabolic Rule”). This surrogate measurement is especially useful in HVAC and smart building applications where traditional CO₂ sensors might not detect odor or bio-effluents.
Range:
400 to 65,000 parts per million (ppm)
Standards & Calibration:
Designed to align with traditional CO₂-based ventilation standards, the eCO₂ output allows for a direct comparison with NDIR CO₂ sensor readings in indoor environments. It incorporates human metabolic correlation factors to translate VOC data into CO₂-equivalent values.
AQI (Air Quality Index)
Description:
A simplified air quality metric that classifies the environment based on the combined sensor readings (TVOC and eCO₂), providing an easy-to-understand index.
Range:
1 to 5
1: Excellent
2: Good
3: Moderate
4: Poor
5: Unhealthy
Standards & Calibration:
The AQI provided by the ENS160 is based on the UBA (German Federal Environmental Agency) guidelines, ensuring that the index corresponds to internationally recognized indoor air quality standards. This output helps users make immediate decisions about ventilation and air purification.
Additional Notes
Interfaces:
The sensor outputs are available via digital I²C or SPI interfaces.

Compensation:
On-chip algorithms adjust for ambient temperature and relative humidity, improving accuracy under varying indoor conditions.

Integration:
With its compact 3×3×0.9 mm LGA package and pre-calibrated outputs, the ENS160 is ideal for applications in air purification, HVAC systems, smart home devices, and building automation.
